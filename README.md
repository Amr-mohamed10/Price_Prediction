# Airbnb Price Prediction Project

## Introduction

The **Airbnb Price Prediction Project** aims to create a predictive model that estimates the rental prices of Airbnb properties based on various features. Predicting rental prices accurately is crucial for both hosts and guests, as it helps hosts set competitive prices and assists guests in making informed decisions. This README provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and the steps involved.

## 1. Project Overview<a name="project-overview"></a>

### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the rental prices of Airbnb properties. This predictive model will take into account various features such as property details, location, amenities, and historical data to make accurate price estimations.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about Airbnb rental properties, including but not limited to:
- Property characteristics (e.g., number of bedrooms, bathrooms, size)
- Location details (e.g., city, district)
- Property amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, parking)
- Historical rental data (e.g., previous prices, booking duration)

## 2. Getting Started<a name="getting-started"></a>

### Importing Libraries<a name="importing-libraries"></a>

We begin by importing the necessary Python libraries required for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. These libraries include:
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization
- scikit-learn for machine learning tasks

### Loading the Dataset<a name="loading-the-dataset"></a>

We load the dataset from a CSV file ('data.csv') using Pandas. Basic information about the dataset, such as the number of rows and columns, is displayed.

## 3. Data Preprocessing<a name="data-preprocessing"></a>

### Handling Duplicates<a name="handling-duplicates"></a>

We identify and remove duplicate rows from the dataset to ensure data quality and prevent duplication-related biases in our analysis.

### Renaming Columns<a name="renaming-columns"></a>

To ensure consistency, we rename three columns ('country', 'city', 'district') to 'country_Id', 'city_Id', and 'district_Id'.

### Handling Missing Values<a name="handling-missing-values"></a>

Missing values are addressed in multiple steps:
- Null values in the 'district_Id' column are imputed using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputer.
- Numerical columns with missing values are filled with zeros and converted to integers.

### Outlier Detection<a name="outlier-detection"></a>

We detect and handle outliers in the dataset:
- High percentage outliers: Log transformation is applied to mitigate the impact of outliers while retaining data points.
- Low percentage outliers: Robust machine learning models are employed to handle these outliers effectively.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)<a name="exploratory-data-analysis-eda"></a>

### Correlation Analysis<a name="correlation-analysis"></a>

We calculate and visualize the correlation between numerical columns and the target variable ('price'). This analysis helps us understand which features are most strongly correlated with rental prices.

### Data Visualization<a name="data-visualization"></a>

We create various visualizations, including histograms and scatter plots, to gain insights into the data distribution and relationships between variables. These visualizations enhance our understanding of the dataset.

## 5. Feature Engineering<a name="feature-engineering"></a>

Feature engineering is a crucial step in model development:
- Skewed data is subjected to log transformation to reduce skewness.
- Categorical variables are one-hot encoded for compatibility with machine learning algorithms.
- The dataset is split into feature data (X) and the target variable (y).

## 6. Modeling and Evaluation<a name="modeling-and-evaluation"></a>

### Feature Scaling<a name="feature-scaling"></a>

Standardization is applied to feature data using a StandardScaler, ensuring that all features have the same scale.

### Feature Selection<a name="feature-selection"></a>

Feature selection is performed using SelectKBest with an ANOVA F-test. This process helps identify the most relevant features for modeling.

### Model Selection<a name="model-selection"></a>

Multiple regression models are considered, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regression (SVR).

### Model Evaluation<a name="model-evaluation"></a>

The models are evaluated on training and validation sets using common regression metrics:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R-squared (R^2)

## 7. Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>

In the conclusion section, we summarize the project's findings, including the best-performing model and its evaluation results. We reflect on the project's success in achieving its objectives.

## 8. Future Work<a name="future-work"></a>

We suggest potential areas for future work, such as incorporating additional features, collecting more data, or exploring advanced modeling techniques. Future improvements can enhance the accuracy and robustness of the predictive model.

## 9. References<a name="references"></a>

We provide references to data sources, libraries, and other resources used in the project, acknowledging their contributions to the project's success.
